<h1 align="center">Project Hyperion</h1>

<p align='justify'>
  In mythology, Hyperion is the Titan who stands watch over the sky, bringing light through observation, patience, and consistency. He does not rush. He rises every day, sees farther, and understands more with time.
  <br><br>
  This repository follows the same philosophy. Project Hyperion is a long-term journey to master problem solving, algorithms, and competitive coding through deliberate, focused practice. Each solution here represents more than a correct answer. It reflects the process of breaking problems down, recognizing patterns, and learning to think clearly under constraints.
  <br><br>
  Progress in this repository is intentional and cumulative. Concepts build on one another, mistakes are revisited, and familiar patterns return with deeper meaning. Over time, what once felt complex becomes instinctive.
  <br><br>
  Hyperion exists to turn disciplined effort into durable skill and steady practice into technical confidence.
  <br>
  Not a sprint. A rising orbit.
